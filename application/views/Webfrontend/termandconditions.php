    <h1>Conditions of Use for the Online Portal EFynch</h1>
    <h2>GENERAL REMARKS ON HOW IT WORKS</h2>
    <p>Welcome to EFynch – a product of EFynch.Com (“EFynch.Com“).  The following Conditions of Use govern your use of this EFynch website/portal and EFynch via mobile application (collectively, “EFynch Portal”), an Electronic Product, whether to visit the site or register to become a “Designated User” of the EFynch Portal. <strong>If you visit the EFynch Portal, you accept these Conditions of Use</strong>.  These Conditions of Use, as amended from time to time, supplement any terms and conditions in any other agreement.</p>

    <p>EFynch.Com provides this EFynch Portal to Users, free of charge, to solicit bids from Service Professionals for their projects, including, but not limited to, electrical work, plumbing work, landscaping and yard work, hardscaping work, garbage removal, kitchen/bath renovations, roofing work, painting, and other minor and major projects. Users can upload project related information and descriptions for review and bidding by Service Professionals.  The EFynch Portal offers a platform on which Service Professionals can then submit bids and other information to the User to compare.  Service Professionals, pursuant to a separate license agreement, pay a license fee for the use of the EFynch Portal per project, which fee is based upon a percentage of the project value (“Service Professional license fee“).  Once the User selects a Service Professional, EFynch allows the Service Professional and User to easily exchange information regarding the project, including contract documents, drawings, change orders, invoicing, communication and other project documents.   The User does not pay the Service Professional upfront; rather, the following business day after the User and Service Professional enter into a contract for the project, the User escrows the contract amount with EFynch.Com and then directs EFynch.Com when to release funds to the Service Professional during the course of the project.  Users can then submit an assessment of the Service Professional and the Service Professionals can respond to the assessment via the EFynch Portal. EFynch.Com reserves the right to remove any assessments or comments that it deems, in its sole discretion and without recourse or liability to the Service Professional or User, to violate these terms.</p>

    <h3>DISCLAIMERS DIRECT TO USERS</h3>
    <p>Service Professionals are not screened by EFynch.Com.   Service Professionals must register as a Designated User, to bid any Work and, as part of that process, each Service Professional must represent, acknowledge and affirm the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Licensing</strong>. Each Service Professional must acknowledge that it is properly licensed by the State or Local authorities, if applicable, to perform any Work for which it bids. Before accepting any bids, Users should confirm these licensing requirements with the applicable state and local licensing authorities.</li>
      <li><strong>Permits</strong>. Each Service Professional must also acknowledge that it will conform to any requirements regarding permitting and governmental approval <strong>required by the county or local authority in which the Work is being performed. We recommend you confirm these permitting and approval requirements before proceeding with your project. Some states and local authorities hold Users liable for failing to obtain proper permits and governmental approval for Work</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Subcontractors or Subcontractor</strong>.   Larger projects often require the use of subcontractors or other trades for specific types of Work. Each Service Professional must acknowledge that it will only subcontract with individuals or companies properly licensed by the State or Local authorities, if applicable, to perform any portion of the Work.  Users should confirm these licensing requirements with the applicable State and Local licensing authorities to verify that all the subcontractors doing Work carry the appropriate licensing.  EFynch.Com cannot verify the licensing status of Service Professionals or subcontractors and relies on the representation of the Service Professionals. </li>
      <li><strong>State Business Filings</strong> – If a Service Professional is a corporation or limited liability company, that Service Professional must acknowledge that it is in good standing in the state in which it is located.  Users should check with the state body governing corporations to confirm this information.</li>

Furthermore, Users may be able to check the Sex Offender Registry of the state in which the Service Professional resides or is in business. EFynch.Com does not run sex offender searches in any states.   Civil and criminal records may also be publicly available in the state in which the Service Professional resides or is in business.</li>
      <li><strong>Qualifications</strong>.  EFynch.Com will take certain steps to bar any Service Professional from the use of the EFynch Portal if EFynch.Com is informed of i) a Service Professional’s false or inaccurate representation, acknowledgment or affirmation related to becoming a Designated User or in connection with the use of the EFynch Portal; or ii) any failure to complete the Work pursuant to industry standards and applicable laws. EFynch.Com makes no guarantees or representations regarding the skills or representations of any Service Professional or the quality of the job that he or she may perform. <strong>EFynch.Com does not endorse, solicit or recommend the services of any Service Professional</strong>.

The User’s rights are governed by the contractual relationship with the Service Professional selected to perform the Work, and the User agrees that any dispute regarding the performance of the Work will rest solely with the Service Professional and not with EFynch.Com.  You agree that EFynch.Com is not responsible for the accessibility or unavailability of any Service Professional or for your interactions and dealings with any Service Professional, waive the right to bring or assert any claim against EFynch.Com relating to any interactions or dealings with any Service Professional, and release EFynch.Com from any and all liability for or relating to any interactions or dealings with Service Professionals or the Work.</li>

EFynch.Com shall hold the deposit in trust for the User for the payment of the Work.   EFynch.Com shall promptly and no later than seven (7) days from receipt of the same deposit the money in an account that is maintained by EFynch.Com in a financial institution that has one or more branch locations in the State in which the Work is performed and whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.   Such account need not be an interest bearing checking or saving account or any combination thereof.  EFynch.Com shall maintain the money in the account until:</p>
    <ul>
      <ol>Directed by the User to pay the Service Professional any whole or part thereof for the Work.</ol>
      <ol>Directed by the User to return the contract price to the User due to a cancellation of the Work, in which case, the contract price shall be returned less any credit card or bank processing fees incurred by EFynch.Com.  EFynch.Com shall also be entitled to withhold that portion of the Service Professional’s License Fee in proportion to the amount paid to the Service Professional for the Work performed.</ol>
      <ol>Directed by the User to return the contract price to the User due to a good-faith dispute regarding the performance of the Service Professional relative to any part of the Work, in which case, the contract price shall be returned less any credit card or bank processing fees incurred by EFynch.Com and EFynch.Com shall retain and hold in trust the Service Professional’s Licensing Fee to be held pending a resolution or settlement of the dispute between Service Professional and the User.  EFynch.Com shall be entitled to that portion of the Service Professional’s License Fee in proportion to the amount paid to the Service Professional  as part of any resolution or settlement, including any judgment.</ol>
      <ol>A Court directs EFynch.Com to distribute the money in a different manner.
        <p>Service Professional and User agree that EFynch.Com shall have the right to offset from any payment to the Service Professional any amounts due by Service Professional to EFynch.Com for Service Professional’s use of the EFynch Portal.</p>
        <p>In the event of any dispute or litigation between User and Service Professional regarding the contract price held by EFynch.Com, User and Service Professional agree that EFynch.Com shall have the option to pay the money into a Court and neither User nor Service Professional has any further right, claim, demand or action against EFynch.Com related to the deposit.  If EFynch.Com elects to pay the money to the User in lieu of the Court, Service Professional has no right, claim, demand or action against EFynch.Com related to the deposit.  Any action for non-payment related to the Work shall rest solely between User and Service Professional, and User and Service Professional each agree to indemnify and defend EFynch.Com from any claim by the other related to the payment of the Work.  In the event EFynch.Com pays the deposit into a court vis-à-vis a interpleader or other action, EFynch.Com shall have the right to deduct from the deposit its filing fees, court costs, service of process fees and attorneys’ fees, provided the amount does not exceed the amount of the deposit.   The forgoing fees, as well as any other fees due EFynch.Com hereunder, may be deducted by EFynch.Com before the money is paid into the Court.   And, if the amount deducted is less than the actual fees incurred by EFynch.Com in that action, then the User and Service Professional agree that the balance may be deducted prior to the payment of the deposit to the User or Service Professional as directed by the Court, as the case may be.</p>
